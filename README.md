# times-tables

TimesTables.py is a simple command line game I initially wrote up to help my son learn and test himself on his times tables.  
With schools closing down around the country due to COVID-19, I figured I would dig this up and share it in case anyone has young children at home who could use a little math practice.

## Program prerequisites

All you need is Python!
TimesTables.py will run on any computer and operating system, as long as Python is installed.
If you don't have Python on your computer, it can be downloaded at https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

## Run Program

1. Download TimesTables.py and save it to a folder or your desktop.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt
3. Navigate to the folder where TimesTables.py is saved (e.g., if it is saved to the desktop, you can type `cd Desktop`)
4. Type `TimesTables.py` or `python TimesTables.py` (You may have to type `python3 TimesTables.py` if you have Python 2 installed on your computer as well) 
5. Have your child follow the prompts, and relax for a few minutes while they sharpen their mind!
